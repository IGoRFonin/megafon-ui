The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel\n * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.\n * Provide `options` to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on the\n * leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked\n * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent\n * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`\n * invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function\n * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n */\n\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var lastArgs,\n      lastThis,\n      maxWait,\n      result,\n      timerId,\n      lastCallTime,\n      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n      leading = false,\n      maxing = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n\n  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\n\n  if (isObject(options)) {\n    leading = !!options.leading;\n    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\n    maxWait = maxing ?

This results in the `mdxPlugins` being required\n * and available to the code after this import.\n *\n * # Have a better solution to this?\n * Submit a PR\n */\n\nimport { plugins as mdxPlugins } from \"./loaders/mdx-components\";\nimport scopeContexts from \"./loaders/mdx-scopes\";\nimport { jsx as ___EmotionJSX } from \"@emotion/core\";\nvar componentsAndGuards = {};\n\nvar componentFromGuards = function componentFromGuards(arr) {\n  return function GatsbyMDXComponentFinder(props) {\n    var _arr$find = arr.find(function (_ref) {\n      var guard = _ref.guard;\n      return guard ? guard(props) : true;\n    }),\n        Component = _arr$find.Component;\n\n    return ___EmotionJSX(Component, props);\n  };\n};\n\nmdxPlugins.forEach(function (_ref2) {\n  var _ref2$guards = _ref2.guards,\n      guards = _ref2$guards === void 0 ? {} : _ref2$guards,\n      components = _ref2.components;\n  Object.entries(components).forEach(function (_ref3) {\n    var componentName = _ref3[0],\n        Component = _ref3[1];\n\n    if (componentsAndGuards[componentName]) {\n      componentsAndGuards.push({\n        guard: guards[componentName],\n        Component: Component\n      });\n    } else {\n      componentsAndGuards[componentName] = [{\n        guard: guards[componentName],\n        Component: Component\n      }];\n    }\n  });\n});\nvar components = Object.entries(componentsAndGuards).map(function (_ref4) {\n  var _ref5;\n\n  var name = _ref4[0],\n      arr = _ref4[1];\n  return _ref5 = {}, _ref5[name] = componentFromGuards(arr.concat({\n    guard: undefined,\n    Component: name\n  })), _ref5;\n}).reduce(function (acc, obj) {\n  return _objectSpread({}, acc, {}, obj);\n}, {}); // merge any components in wrapRootElement above this wrapRoot\n\nvar MDXConsumer = withMDXComponents(function (_ref6) {\n  var componentsFromContext = _ref6.components,\n      children = _ref6.children;\n  return ___EmotionJSX(MDXScopeProvider, {\n    __mdxScope: scopeContexts\n  }, ___EmotionJSX(MDXProvider, {\n    components: _objectSpread({}, componentsFromContext, {}, components)\n  }, children));\n});\n\nvar WrapRootElement = function WrapRootElement(_ref7) {\n  var element = _ref7.element;\n  return ___EmotionJSX(MDXConsumer, null, element);\n};\n\nexport default WrapRootElement;\n\nif (typeof WrapRootElement !== 'undefined' && WrapRootElement && WrapRootElement === Object(WrapRootElement) && Object.isExtensible(WrapRootElement) && !WrapRootElement.hasOwnProperty('__filemeta')) {\n  Object.defineProperty(WrapRootElement, '__filemeta', {\n    configurable: true,\n    value: {\n      name: \"WrapRootElement\",\n      filename: \"node_modules/gatsby-plugin-mdx/wrap-root-element.js\"\n    }\n  });\n}","import \"core-js/modules/es6.object.define-property\";\nimport \"core-js/modules/es6.object.is-extensible\";\nimport \"core-js/modules/es6.object.is-extensible\";\nimport wrap from \"./wrap-root-element\";\nexport var wrapRootElement = wrap;\n\nif (typeof wrapRootElement !== 'undefined' && wrapRootElement && wrapRootElement === Object(wrapRootElement) && Object.isExtensible(wrapRootElement) && !wrapRootElement.hasOwnProperty('__filemeta')) {\n  Object.defineProperty(wrapRootElement, '__filemeta', {\n    configurable: true,\n    value: {\n      name: \"wrapRootElement\",\n      filename: \"node_modules/gatsby-plugin-mdx/gatsby-browser.js\"\n    }\n  });\n}","'use strict';\nvar global = require('./_global');\nvar $export = require('./_export');\nvar redefine = require('./_redefine');\nvar redefineAll = require('./_redefine-all');\nvar meta = require('./_meta');\nvar forOf = require('./_for-of');\nvar anInstance = require('./_an-instance');\nvar isObject = require('./_is-object');\nvar fails = require('./_fails');\nvar $iterDetect = require('./_iter-detect');\nvar setToStringTag = require('./_set-to-string-tag');\nvar inheritIfRequired = require('./_inherit-if-required');\n\nmodule.exports = function (NAME, wrapper, methods, common, IS_MAP, IS_WEAK) {\n  var Base = global[NAME];\n  var C = Base;\n  var ADDER = IS_MAP ?
